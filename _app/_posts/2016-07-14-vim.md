Vim is my favorite editor. I've been using it for a year.

Here are some tips and tricks I've learned over time.

| Command  | Are           | Cool  |
| -------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| <code>hello</code>      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
