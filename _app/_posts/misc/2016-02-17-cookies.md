Emmy and I made cookies for Valentine's Day! üç™

I bought a bunch of ingredients, including chocolate chunks, vanilla chips, and trail mix. We discovered ingredients in the dorm kitchen and used some of those, too.

We made chocolate chip and oatmeal trail mix cookies. We also experimented and made cookies with interesting ingredient combinations for fun: chocolate and chili powder, butterscotch and vanilla, and even a few with all of our ingredients.

The whole process was five hours from start to finish. Our first batch of chocolate chip cookies didn't turn so well: we added too many chocolate chunks, which made the cookies too soft and impossible to pick up without crumbling. The first oatmeal cookies were also too big. However, we learned from our initial mistakes and the remaining batches turned out a little better (with the exception of the third batch of oatmeal cookies, which we left in the oven too long and burned).

At about the one-hour mark, both of us started feeling nauseous from the sugary sweet scent of cookie dough, but we persevered and kept baking cookies until we ran out of dough.

We gave away almost all of the cookies. Seeing smiles and hearing praises from friends made it all worthwhile!

I don't know about Emmy, but I think I've had enough cookies to satisfy me for a couple months.
