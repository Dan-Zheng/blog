Emmy and I made cookies for Valentine's Day! 🍪

I bought a bunch of ingredients, including vanilla chips and trail mix. We discovered ingredients in the dorm kitchen and used some of those too.

We made chocolate chip and oatmeal trail mix cookies. We also experimented and made cookies with interesting ingredient combinations for fun.
