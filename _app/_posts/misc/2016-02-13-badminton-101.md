Badminton is a fun sport enjoyed by people all over the world. The aim is simple: to hit the shuttle with your racket so that it passes over the net and lands inside your opponent's half of the court. When this happens, you win a rally and get a point; get enough points and you win the match.

Your opponent has the same goal as you: he or she will try to reach the shuttle and hit it over the net into your half of the court. If your opponent makes a mistake and hits the shuttle into the net or out of bounds, you win the rally. If you make a mistake, your opponent wins the point.
